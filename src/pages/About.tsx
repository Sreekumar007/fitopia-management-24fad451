              <p>
                FitWell was founded in 2020 by a team of fitness enthusiasts and technology experts who recognized the need 
                for better management solutions in the fitness industry. After working with dozens of gyms and fitness centers, 
                we identified common pain points and developed a platform that addresses these challenges head-on.
